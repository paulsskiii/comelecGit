Activity: Simulating a Pull Request

Objective: Create a feature branch, add a dummy file to your personal folder, and submit a Pull Request (PR) for review.

Step 1: Create your Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch. This ensures you aren't working directly on the main or master branch.

Format: (YourName)PR

Command:

Bash
git checkout -b bertPR
(Replace bertPR with your actual name, e.g., josephPR, shaPR)

Step 2: Navigate to your Folder

Locate your specific folder inside the Files directory.

Command:

Bash
cd Files/bert
(Replace bert with your specific folder name shown in the file explorer)

Step 3: Create the Dummy File

Create a text file named gitAct2.txt and add some dummy text to it.

Step 4: Stage and Commit the Changes

Now, save your changes to your new branch.

Command (Stage the file):

Bash
git add gitAct2.txt
Command (Commit):

Bash
git commit -m "Added gitAct2.txt for PR simulation"
Step 5: Push the Branch

Upload your new branch to the remote repository (GitHub/GitLab).

Command:

Bash
git push -u origin bertPR
(Remember to use the exact branch name you created in Step 1)

Step 6: Create the Pull Request

Go to the repository link in your web browser.

You should see a yellow banner saying "bertPR had recent pushes less than a minute ago" (or similar).

Click the green "Compare & pull request" button.

Ensure the title is descriptive and click "Create pull request."

Do not merge it yourself! Wait for the instructor to review.
