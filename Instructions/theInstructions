 Objective

Create your own directory with your daily activities.

Work on a personal feature branch.

Upload your acts.

Merge your work into the Main branch.

Phase 1: Setup & Branching

1. Clone the Repository (If you haven't already):

  
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
2. Create Your Personal Branch:

Naming convention: user/<your-firstname>

  
git checkout -b user/yourname
# Example: git checkout -b user/juan
Phase 2: The Work (File Structure)

1. Create Your Directory Structure: Navigate to the Files folder and create a folder with your name. Inside that, create the structure for Day 1 and Day 2.

Structure:

Plaintext
Files/
└── <Your_Name>/
    ├── Day 1/
    │   ├── Module 1.txt
    │   └── Module 2.txt
    └── Day 2/
        ├── Module 1.txt
        └── Module 2.txt
2. Add Content: Fill the module text files with your activity answers.

3. Stage and Commit Your Work:

  
git add .
git commit -m "Added activity files for <Your Name>"
Phase 3: Pushing & Merging

1. Push Your Branch: Upload your personal branch to the remote repository.

  
git push -u origin user/yourname
2. Update Your Local Main: Before merging, it is best practice to ensure your local main is up to date.

  
git checkout main
git pull origin main
3. Merge Your Branch: Now, merge your personal branch into the main branch. Since you are only adding new files in your own folder, this should proceed automatically without conflicts.

  
git merge user/yourname
4. Push Changes to Main: Sync the merged changes back to the remote repository.

  
git push origin main
