Objective:

Create your own directory with your daily activities.

Work on a personal feature branch.

Simulate a collaboration conflict by editing a shared file.

Upload Your acts

Merge your work into the Main branch and resolve the resulting conflict.

Phase 1: Setup & Branching

Clone the Repository (If you haven't already):


git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Create Your Personal Branch:

Naming convention: user/<your-firstname>

  
git checkout -b user/yourname
# Example: git checkout -b user/juan
Phase 2: The Work (File Structure)

Create Your Directory Structure: Navigate to the Files folder and create a folder with your name. Inside that, create the structure for Day 1 and Day 2.

Structure:

Plaintext
Files/
└── <Your_Name>/
    ├── Day 1/
    │   ├── Module 1.txt
    │   └── Module 2.txt
    └── Day 2/
        ├── Module 1.txt
        └── Module 2.txt
Add Content: Fill the module text files with dummy data or your activity answers.

Add your name to the very top line of the file (Do not append it to the bottom; overwrite or push the top line down).

Note: Since everyone is editing the top line, this will force a conflict.

Stage and Commit Your Work:

  
git add .
git commit -m "Added activity files for <Your Name> and updated attendance"



Phase 3: Pushing & Simulating the Conflict

Push Your Branch: Upload your personal branch to the remote repository.

  
git push -u origin user/yourname
Update Your Local Main: Now, imagine your classmates have already pushed their code to main. You need to pull their changes before you can merge yours.

  
git checkout main
git pull origin main
Attempt the Merge (The Conflict Happens Here): Now, try to merge your personal branch into the main branch.

  
git merge user/yourname
STOP! You should see an error message similar to:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in attendance.txt Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.




Phase 4: Resolving the Conflict

You cannot push to main until this is fixed. Git is confused because you edited the top line of attendance.txt, but someone else (or the original file) has different content there.

Open the Conflicted File: Open attendance.txt in your code editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.).

Find the Conflict Markers: Look for these symbols:

Plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
(Content currently in Main)
=======
(Your Name that you added)
>>>>>>> user/yourname
Fix the Code:

Decide how the final file should look. In this case, keep both names or arrange them in a list.

Delete the marker lines (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).

Ensure the list looks clean.

Finalize the Merge: Once the file is saved and clean:

  
git add attendance.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in attendance list"
Push to Main: Now that the conflict is resolved and your files are merged:

  
git push origin main
Success! You have successfully uploaded your files and resolved a merge conflict.
